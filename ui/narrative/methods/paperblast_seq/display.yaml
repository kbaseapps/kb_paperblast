    <p>This is a Narrative method for running <a href="http://papers.genomics.lbl.gov/">PaperBLAST</a>.

    <p>PaperBLAST is software that finds open access publications that may be relative to a gene of interest, based on sequence similarity between between your gene of interest and a gene described in the publication.</p>

    <H3><A NAME="stats">Statistics</A></H3>

    The PaperBLAST database links 401,049 different protein sequences to 723,768 scientific articles. Searches against EuropePMC were last performed on March 26 2017.

    <H3><A NAME="works">How It Works</A></H3>

    <P>PaperBLAST builds a database of protein sequences that are linked
    to scientific articles. These links come from automated text searches
    against the articles in <A HREF="http://europepmc.org/">EuropePMC</A>
    and from manually-curated information from <A
    HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/about-generif" title="Gene
    Reference into Function (NCBI)">GeneRIF</A>, <A
    HREF="http://www.uniprot.org/">Swiss-Prot</A>, and <A
    HREF="http://ecocyc.org">EcoCyc</A>.  As of March 2017, PaperBLAST
    links over 360,000 different protein sequences to over 700,000
    articles.  Given this database and a protein sequence query,
    PaperBLAST uses <A
    HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAST">protein-protein BLAST</A>
    to find similar sequences with E &lt; 0.001.

    <P>To build the database, we query EuropePMC with locus tags, with <A
    HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/">RefSeq</A> protein
    identifiers, and with <A HREF="http://www.uniprot.org/">UniProt</A>
    accessions.  We obtain the locus tags from RefSeq or from <A
    HREF="http://www.microbesonline.org/">MicrobesOnline</A>.  We use
    queries of the form "locus_tag AND genus_name" to try to ensure that
    the paper is actually discussing that gene.  Because EuropePMC indexes
    most recent biomedical papers, even if they are not open access, some
    of the links may be to papers that you cannot read or that our
    computers cannot read.  We query each of these identifiers that
    appears in the open access part of EuropePMC, as well as every locus
    tag that appears in the 500 most-referenced genomes, so that a gene
    may appear in the PaperBLAST results even though none of the papers
    that mention it are open access. We also incorporate text mined links
    from EuropePMC that link open access articles to UniProt or RefSeq
    identifiers.  (This yields some additional links because EuropePMC
    uses different heuristics for their text mining than we do.)

    <P>For every article that mentions a locus tag, a RefSeq protein
    identifier, or a UniProt accession, we try to select one or two
    snippets of text that refer to the protein. If we cannot get access to
    the full text, we try to select a snippet from the abstract, but
    unfortunately, unique identifiers such as locus tags are rarely
    provided in abstracts.

    <P>We also use manually-curated links between protein sequences and
    articles: <UL> <LI>We index proteins from NCBI's RefSeq if a GeneRIF
    entries links the gene to an article in <A
    HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">PubMed</A><sup>&reg;</sup>.
    GeneRIF also provides a short summary of the article's claim about the
    protein, which we provide instead of a snippet.  <LI>We index proteins
    from Swiss-Prot (the curated part of UniProt) if the curators
    identified experimental evidence for the protein's function (evidence
    code ECO:0000269).  <LI>We index every protein EcoCyc, a curated
    database of the proteins in <i> Escherichia coli</i> K-12.  </UL> For
    the entries from Swiss-Prot and EcoCyc, we provide a short curated
    description of the protein's function.  Most of these entries also
    link to articles in <A
    HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">PubMed</A>.

    <P>For more information see the <A HREF="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/02/133041">preprint</A> or the
    <A
    HREF="https://github.com/morgannprice/PaperBLAST">code</A>.

    <H3><A NAME="secret">Secrets</A></H3>

    <P>PaperBLAST cannot provide snippets for many of the papers that are
    published in non-open-access journals. This limitation applies even if
    the paper is marked as "free" on the publisher's web site and is
    available in PubmedCentral or EuropePMC. If a journal that you publish
    in is marked as "secret," please consider publishing elsewhere.

    <H3><A NAME="omission">Omissions from the PaperBLAST Database</A></H3>

    <P>Some important articles are missing from PaperBLAST, either because
    the article's full text is not in EuropePMC (as for many older
    articles) or because of PaperBLAST's heuristics. If you notice an
    article that characterizes a protein's function but is missing from
    PaperBLAST, please notify the curators at <A
    HREF="http://www.uniprot.org/update">UniProt</A> or add an entry to <A
    HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/submit-generif">GeneRIF</A>.
    Entries in either of these databases will eventually be incorporated
    into PaperBLAST.  Note that to add an entry to UniProt, you will need
    find the UniProt identifier for the protein.  If the protein is not
    already in UniProt, you can ask them to create an entry.  To add an
    entry to GeneRIF, you will need an NCBI Gene identifier, but
    unfortunately many prokaryotic proteins in RefSeq do not have
    corresponding Gene identifers.
